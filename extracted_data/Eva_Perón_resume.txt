Start by identifying and extracting details for each distinct project, the employer, the job title, and the technical skills utilized in each project.2. For each distinct project, create a separate JSON object.3. The JSON object for each project must include the following keys: 'project_name', 'employer', 'job_title', and 'technical_skills'.4. Represent the corresponding values for each key as Python lists or strings. Each individual item within the 'technical_skills' list should be separated by commas.For instance, a list of technical skills for a specific project might appear as: ['JavaScript', 'React', 'Firebase'].5. If you cannot find the information corresponding to any of the keys, ensure that this key is still included in the JSON object.However, in such cases, assign its value as an empty Python list or empty string.For example, if no technical skills are associated with a particular project, you should include: 'technical_skills': [] in the JSON object.Similarly, if no employer or job title is found related to the project, you should include: 'employer': '', 'job_title': '' in the JSON object.6. Repeat these steps for each distinct project identified."}
